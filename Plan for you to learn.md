# Plan for you to learn

Learn Python from whatever sources you're learning

After doing that you can try and explore some challenges for you to learn by application.

- Do Coding Challenges from Hacker Rank, they have some great resources for you to learn as well as practice coding in Python, and more languages.
- Create some basic applications on the basis of what you have learned, likely a command-line time zone converter, currency translator etc.
- Then you can move forward to Web Based Framework like Flask, Django for web-development.(Make sure to learn the basics as well)
